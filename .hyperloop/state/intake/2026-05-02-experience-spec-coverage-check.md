# Intake: specs/ui/experience.spec.md (modified) — 2026-05-02

**Spec blob SHA:** `e77913c2cc6d8b719291e2dbb6870519a94d50da`

## Summary

Re-processed `specs/ui/experience.spec.md` at current HEAD. Performed line-by-line
verification of all 59 scenarios across 18 requirements against existing tasks
(task-001 through task-076).

**Result: No new tasks required.** All scenarios are covered.

After the initial check (through task-075), task-076 was created to fill the final
micro-gap: the `permission=edit` query parameter in the Mutations Console KG list API
call was implemented in `mutations.vue` (line 150) but not asserted in any test.
Task-076 adds that assertion to `mutations-workspace-selector.test.ts`.

## Spec History

The current spec blob (`e77913c2cc6d8b719291e2dbb6870519a94d50da`) was introduced
in commit `e3d22bccf` ("docs(ui): add backend API alignment and mutations console
graph selection specs"). Since the prior intake (2026-05-01 22:31, covering through
task-072), three additional tasks were generated to close remaining gaps:

| Task | What It Adds |
|---|---|
| task-073 | Dedicated sync history table, log viewer, and manual-trigger tests (previously spread across task-041/task-044/task-015) |
| task-074 | Workspace-scoped KG selector in Mutations Console (task-065 used tenant-wide listing, not workspace-scoped) |
| task-075 | UI list auto-refresh after CRUD for api-keys and workspaces pages (task-072 only covered KG and data-sources) |
| task-076 | Test that `permission=edit` is passed to KG list API in Mutations Console (implementation existed in mutations.vue line 150 but no test assertion existed) |

All prior scenarios and requirements remain covered by tasks from earlier passes.

## Code-Level Verification Findings

Key spot-checks performed against the actual implementation:

- **`triggerSync()`** in `data-sources/index.vue` exists and posts to
  `/management/data-sources/${dsId}/sync`; auth is enforced server-side (403 if
  no `manage` permission). The spec's GIVEN condition is a precondition, not a
  frontend enforcement requirement. ✓
- **`viewLogs()` / `fetchRunLogs()`** are implemented in `data-sources/index.vue`
  and tested in `knowledge-graphs.test.ts` (lines 388–497). Coverage is functional
  but co-located with KG tests; task-073 consolidates dedicated tests. ✓
- **Mutations Console workspace scoping**: `pages/graph/mutations.vue` has 0
  references to `workspaceId` — confirms task-074 is correctly identified as
  outstanding work. ✓
- **Tenant selector refresh**: `default.layout.test.ts` verifies aria-label and
  multi-tenant computed values, but does not assert full page data refresh on
  tenant switch. task-058 remains valid outstanding work. ✓
- **Task-072 implemented**: commit `823db6fa1` (Task-Ref: task-072) added list
  refresh tests for KG and data-source pages. Task status still shows `not-started`
  (orchestrator manages status); the implementation is present. task-075 extends
  this to api-keys and workspaces pages. ✓

## Conclusion

**No new task files created.** The spec is fully covered at blob SHA
`e77913c2cc6d8b719291e2dbb6870519a94d50da` by existing tasks 014–076.

### Final verification: mutations console `permission=edit` clause

Code confirmed in `src/dev-ui/app/pages/graph/mutations.vue` (line 150):
```typescript
{ query: { permission: 'edit', workspace_id: selectedWorkspaceId.value } },
```
Test in `src/dev-ui/app/tests/mutations-workspace-selector.test.ts` (line 103–105)
verifies `workspace_id` only — task-076 adds the corresponding `permission=edit` assertion.
All clauses of the "Knowledge graph selection" scenario are now mapped:

| Clause | Covered by |
|--------|-----------|
| selector displayed before submit | task-065 (`isSubmitDisabled` gating test) |
| lists KGs with `edit` permission | task-076 (permission=edit parameter test) |
| within the current workspace | task-074 (workspace_id parameter test) |
| no submission until KG selected | task-065 (isSubmitDisabled empty-KG case) |
| selected KG is submission target | task-065 (URL includes KG ID in path) |
