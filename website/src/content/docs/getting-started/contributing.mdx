import { Steps, Code, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- UV package manager
- Docker (for Apache AGE database)

## Installation

<Steps>
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/kartograph.git
   cd kartograph
   ```

1. **Install Git Hooks**

   `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks are configured to enforce
   coding standards and validate code with tests. The first time
   you commit, `pre-commit` will install required packages automatically.
   This may take some time, but will only happen once.
   
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install -t pre-commit -t pre-push
   ```

1. **Configure environment**
   
   Default Kartograph configuration files can be found in
   `/env`. 

1. **Run Kartograph**

   Kartograph can quickly be run in development mode using `docker compose`:
   ```bash
   make dev && make logs
   ```
   This will first start the database and application services, with
   auto-reload enabled.
